# PsiloDynamics
Analysing the Neuropixel data from rat mPFC to characterise the neural network dynamics under psilocybin

This repository contains MATLAB codes to perform Mean-Squared Displacement (MSD) and Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) analyses of the spike data recorded using Neuropixel 1.0 from hundreds of neurons in the prelimbic, infralimbic and anterior cingulate regions of the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) of 4 rats administered with single dosages of psilocybin (0.3 and 1.0 mg / kg body weight). For control conditions, saline were injected to the rats before the trials of psilocybin dosages. Each trial session had multiple 15min. resting and active phases (Variable Interval reward tasks). 

The codes were written for the analyses mentioned in: Purple, R. J., Gupta, R., Thomas, C. W., Golden, C. T., Froudist-Walsh, S., & Jones, M. W. (2024). Short-and long-term reconfiguration of rat prefrontal cortical networks following single doses of psilocybin. bioRxiv, 2024-12.
